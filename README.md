# Problem-Statement
We have been given a photo in that there can be a strip of white colored L shape. There is a point called GCP which is the inner corner of L-shape.
We have to detect the location of GCP if it is present in the photo.
This problem led me to learn different ways of approaching the problem and led me to learn new methods of computer vision. Here I will tell you step by step the procedure approached by me

1. A photo was selected in the given folder/for/assignment.

2. Image is blurred so as to remove noice.
